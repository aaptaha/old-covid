This is the source code of the `covid` command used before the Vasanta 2022
release, which fetched data / depended on the now-deprecated
[covid19india API](data.covid19india.org).

Newer APIs which are forks of / compatible with covid19india will still work
with this, subject to some appropriate fine-tuning and modifications.

If you use this (with or without modifications) in your Discord bot, I request

release your bot's source code if it's private.
